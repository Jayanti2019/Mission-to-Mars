# Mission-to-Mars
## Purpose
  We added all four images of Mars's hemispheres. We used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars's hemispheres and the titles of thos images, stored the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application (Bootstrap) to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
